Ingredients

It’s easy to make homemade mozzarella sticks with only a handful of pantry and refrigerator ingredients (see the detailed ingredient list in the print-friendly recipe card below).

    Mozzarella Cheese – One 16 oz block of low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese should yield about 20-24 cheese sticks.
    Flour – For best results use regular all-purpose flour for the breading.
    Garlic Salt – We use garlic salt in place of regular salt for extra flavor.
    Eggs – beaten to form an egg wash which holds the bread crumbs on the cheese sticks.
    Seasoned Breadcrumbs – You’ll love the added flavor of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. If you’re using plain breadcrumbs, mix in a teaspoon of Italian seasoning or dried basil and oregano.
    Oil – For frying, or use cooking spray if you’re baking your mozzarella sticks.

How to Make Mozzarella Cheese Sticks

Ready to make your own ooey-gooey, melty cheese sticks with the crispiest breading? Here’s how to prepare them for frying:

    Set up the Breading Station – Take out three bowls. Whisk the flour together with garlic salt in the first bowl, beat the eggs together in the second, and add your breadcrumbs to the third. 
    Cut the Cheese (hee hee) – Use a sharp knife to cut the block of mozzarella into sticks just under ½” thick by 3” long. You’ll end up with about 20-24 cheese sticks.
    Coat in Breading – Dip each cheese stick first in the flour, then into the egg, then repeat in flour and egg wash. This double-dip method is the secret to well-breaded cheese sticks. Lastly, roll the sticks in the breadcrumbs to get them evenly coated on all sides.
    Freeze – Transfer the breaded cheese sticks to a baking sheet or platter. Once all the sticks are coated, cover them with plastic wrap and freeze for 45 minutes.
